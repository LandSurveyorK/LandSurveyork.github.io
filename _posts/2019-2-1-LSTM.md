### Complains about plugins of WordPress

Yesterday, I started writing blogs in Github. The convenience is that you can edit the blog in local machine and then push them to Github. But I don't like the default theme. WordPress absolutely provides many more pretty themes but it still has the drawbacks of inaccessibility of writing math formulas, unless upgrading your account.  Since I already paid $36 to create my personal domain, I will wait to upgrade my account until I am really satisfied with the service currently provided by WordPress.
