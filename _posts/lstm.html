<h1>Complains about WordPress</h1>

<p>
Yesterday, I started writing blogs in Github. The convenience is that you can edit the blog in local machine and then push them to Github. But I don't like the default theme. 
</p>
<p>
WordPress absolutely provides many more pretty themes but it still has the drawbacks of inaccessibility of writing math formulas, unless upgrading your account.  Since I already paid $36 to create my personal domain, I will wait to upgrade my account until I am really satisfied with the service currently provided by WordPress. </p>

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture[1] used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[2], speech recognition[3][4] and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDS's (intrusion detection systems).

A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problems that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.
